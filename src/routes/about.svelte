        Grandfather's creaky as his front porch, loads his shotgun beneath the
        awning, spittoon restless for rain, carpenter's chair against the
        whistling air. Rocking, back and forth, rocking snap shot picture -
        worth it, just like the movies
      </p>

        She said that he loved baseball, and James Earl Jones; said that he's
        got god talking inside of his thoughts while he's rounding those bases
        on his way back home

        If you build it, they will come (and baby listens to what the Lord say).
        But I've been getting pretty worn, building for nearly a decade

        In a perfect world we shouldn’t have been allowed to lose sight of what
        it means to love wholly. I’ve got a Polaroid hanging on my wall that a
        friend took of me and my angel. I remember the day like it’s something I
        can touch, but it’s stuck in the square between the borders of the film,
        and I can run my fingers over our faces, but I can’t get back to the
        places we were
      </p>

        "You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son. It compels you forward like
        you’re tied to a slave master’s cruel hand, and it's the same pain that
        drives that oppressor’s heart of stone, so you’ve grown to love the man.
        You keep pouring yourself out, again and again, into legible lines
        through a crooked pen." Yeah, it’s painful, but it’s familiar – so habit
        breeds comfort, and I don’t know what I’d do without him
      </p>

        So in the early morning, when you’ve fallen asleep in our home, I drift
        back into the memories that I’ve claimed as my own, and wonder if
        tonight will be a night I’ll hang on my wall like I did before we
        stopped taking photos, out of the habit of being comfortable with not
        trying at all
      </p>

        In a perfect world, we’ll have albums labeled Seasons, with chapter
        headings, and we’ll staple them to the cork-board that hangs at the foot
        of the bed. There’s longevity in a memory spilt out in pen, and if a
        picture is worth a thousand words then I’ve written down every one of
        them
      </p>

        I work hard, scarred, toil through that soil for the youth I see in my
        friends, but these journals are moments in time, snapshots of our lives,
        and in retrospect, age is an overexposed photo that the memories can't
        mend

        I know my that woman, and her name is Depression. I wrote best
        beneath that demon’s destructive oppression

        In those Polaroids, she drove the ink into the canvas like a slave
        beneath his master’s cruel hand, and I hated that whip but always
        wondered what I’d do without it, so I grew to love the man
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, I wept for change! I begged for movement and the good Lord, he
        answered my prayers, but you don’t know how to breathe easy when you let
        go of your habits, even if your comforts left you gasping for air
